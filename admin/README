Install: 
(1) follow the instructions on http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~smaji/projects/mturk/ and install the developer tools for MTURK
(2) edit config.sh and the paths therein
(3) setup the MTURK job (this is the tricky part)
    an example can be found in example/

    Basically, you have to do the following:
        - upload the webpage/ files to your webserver
        - rename all images into short filenames, e.g. 0322.jpg (this is necessary due to annoying parameter length limitations)
        - create the test.input file using the list2mturkinput.py script
        - update the path to your webserver in the configuration files
        - change the cost parameter (the current setting assumes that 10 bounding have to be annotated by each turker and three independent turkers are annotating each image)
        - test everything in the mturk sandbox
            - if the job is complete, use the analyze*.py script to obtain bounding box annotations
              (this script takes also care about the merging)
